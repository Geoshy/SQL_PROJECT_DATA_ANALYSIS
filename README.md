# Introduction:
This project explores the data job market, by delving into data analyst positions, examining the most demand and high-paying skills for Data Analysts, and the intersection of high demand and high paying in data analytics.

You can see all SQL queries for the project here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Tools I Used:
To thoroughly explore the data analyst job market, I utilized the capabilities of a range of essential tools:
1. **SQL:** allowing me to query the database and explore critical insights.
2. **PostgreSQL:** database management system.
3. **Visual Studio Code:** for database management and executing SQL queries.
4. **Excel:** to create charts of the critical insights that are explored from the analysis.
5. **Git & GitHub:** for sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.

# The Analysis
Here are the queries that I employed to uncover the most crucial insights within the database.

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs:
We would highlight the top-paying opportunities for Data Analysts, offering insights into employment.
What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
Considerations: 
1. Identify the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles that are available remotely.
2. Focuses on job postings with specified salaries (remove nulls).

### 7. Top Average Salary Skills For Data Analyst:
This query shows some insights into trends based on the top-paying skills for data analysts, 
and also shows the overlapping between Data Analysts skills with Data Engineers and Data Scientists:
1. **Big Data & Machine Learning:** Demand for skills like PySpark, Databricks, 
and Scikit-learn reflects a need for expertise in big data processing and machine learning.
2. **Cloud & Automation:** Proficiency in GCP, Kubernetes, and Jenkins highlights the importance of cloud platforms,

3. **Collaboration & Specialized Tools:** Skills in Bitbucket, Atlassian, and Microstrategy indicate a focus on collaboration, 
version control, and specialized analytics platforms in high-paying data analyst roles.

These trends showcase the diverse skill sets and technologies that are highly valued in the data analysis field, reflecting the evolving landscape of data-driven decision-making in various industries.

```sql
SELECT
    sd.skill_id AS Skill_ID,
    sd.skills AS Skill,
    FLOOR(AVG(jpf.salary_year_avg)) AS Average_Salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sjd
    ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd
    ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = true AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    sd.skills, sd.skill_id 
ORDER BY
    AVG(jpf.salary_year_avg) DESC
LIMIT
    25;
```

This next query shows that the skill pyspark appears twice according to our conditions:
1. The job title is Data Analyst.
2. Work from home is true.
3. Average year salary is not null.
From this query we can calculate the average salary for all Data Analyst jobs using this this skill: 160515.0 + 255829.5 = 208172
Which is the result in the first row in the last query of the file.

```sql
SELECT
    sd.skills,
    jpf.salary_year_avg
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sjd
    ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd
    ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
WHERE
    jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    jpf.job_work_from_home = true AND
    jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    sd.skills = 'pyspark';

```

### 8. Combine Between Top Demand Skills Top Paying Skills:
In this query, we will show what the most optimal skills to learn (aka itâ€™s in high demand and a high-paying skill), 
to know top_demond_skills.Demond_Count DESC, 
Conditions:
1. Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Analyst roles.
2. Concentrate on remote positions with specified salaries.
Note that jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL.

```sql
WITH top_demand_skills AS (
    SELECT
        sjd.skill_id AS ID,
        sd.skills AS Skill,
        COUNT(jpf.job_id) AS Demand_Count
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS jpf INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sjd
        ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd
        ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
    WHERE
        jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        jpf.job_work_from_home = true AND
        jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        sjd.skill_id, sd.skills
),
top_paying_skills AS (
    SELECT
        sjd.skill_id AS ID,
        sd.skills AS Skill,
        FLOOR(AVG(salary_year_avg)) AS Averge_Salary    
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS jpf INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sjd
        ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd
        ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
    WHERE
        jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        jpf.job_work_from_home = true AND
        jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        sjd.skill_id, sd.skills
)
SELECT
    top_demand_skills.ID,
    top_paying_skills.Skill,
    top_demand_skills.Demand_Count,
    top_paying_skills.Averge_Salary
FROM
   top_demand_skills INNER JOIN top_paying_skills
   ON top_demand_skills.ID = top_paying_skills.ID
WHERE
    top_demand_skills.Demand_Count > 10
ORDER BY
    top_paying_skills.Averge_Salary DESC,
    top_demand_skills.Demand_Count DESC
LIMIT
    25;
```
Or simplify the last query:

```sql
SELECT
    sjd.skill_id AS Skill_Id,
    sd.skills AS Skill,
    COUNT(jpf.job_id) AS Job_Demand,
    FLOOR(AVG(jpf.salary_year_avg)) AS Average_Salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sjd 
    ON jpf.job_id = sjd.job_id INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd
    ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
WHERE
    jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    jpf.job_work_from_home = true AND
    jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    sjd.skill_id, sd.skills
HAVING
    COUNT(jpf.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    Average_Salary DESC,
    Job_Demand DESC
LIMIT
    25;
```
